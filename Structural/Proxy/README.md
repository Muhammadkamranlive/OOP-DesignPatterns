02 - Property proxy
	Using an object as a property instead of just a literal value. Can add some custom behaviors to propertys.

03 - Value proxy
	Typically constructed over a primitive type for a stronger type. Ex: floats that can only represent prices.

04 - Composite proxy: SoA/AoS
	Relevant for processing any kind of large volumes of structured data. AoS = array of structures, SoA = structure of arrays

05 - Composite proxy: Array Backed Properties
	A proxy to manipulate a group of properties;

06 - Dynamic proxy
