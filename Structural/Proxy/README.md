##02 - Property proxy
 - Using an object as a property instead of just a literal value. Can add some custom behaviors to propertys.

##03 - Value proxy
 - Typically constructed over a primitive type for a stronger type. Ex: floats that can only represent prices.

##04 - Composite proxy: SoA/AoS
 - Relevant for processing any kind of large volumes of structured data. AoS = array of structures, SoA = structure of arrays

##05 - Composite proxy: Array Backed Properties
 - A proxy to manipulate a group of properties;

##06 - Dynamic proxy
 - Constructed at runtime;
